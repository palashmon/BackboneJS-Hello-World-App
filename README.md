# BackboneJS-Hello-World-App
Simplest case example of an Hello World app in BackboneJS.

This app simply render a dynamic content using a template.

If you open JavaScript Console you would be able to see Backbone stack trace and in which order Backbone functions are called like:

* Hello World!
  * render @ HelloWorld.js:28
  * initialize @ HelloWorld.js:15
  * e.View @ backbone.js:1224
  * n @ backbone.js:1884
  * (anonymous) @ HelloWorld.js:33

Thanks!
